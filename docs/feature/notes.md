# 📝 Notes - Your Digital Brain

**Capture first. Organize later.**

Unlike regular note apps where you have to manually tag everything, AI Notes uses **AI to automatically tag, summarize, and categorize** your entries.

## 🌟 Why AI Notes are Different

### 1. No More Folder Fatigue
Just write. The AI reads your content and suggests **Tags** (e.g., `#idea`, `#project-launch`, `#meeting`).
It even generates a **1-sentence summary** so you can see what a note is about without opening it.

### 2. Talk to Your Notes
Open any note and click the **✨ Chat** button.
*   Ask: *"Extract action items from this meeting."*
*   Ask: *"Rewrite this in a professional email tone."*
