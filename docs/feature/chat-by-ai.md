# 💬 Chat with Your Second Brain

**Don't just chat with an AI. Chat with _your_ AI.**

Most AI tools don't know who you are. **AI Notes does.** It reads your notes, tasks, and life events to give you personalized, context-aware answers.

*   **"What's the status of Project X?"** (Pulls from Tasks)
*   **"Where did I leave my passport?"** (Pulls from Info Vault)

#### 3. It Takes Action
